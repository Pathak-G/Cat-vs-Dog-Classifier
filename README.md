Cat vs Dog Classifier 🐱🐶

A deep learning project to classify images of cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 
The model was trained using image preprocessing and data augmentation techniques to improve generalization. 
The CNN architecture includes multiple convolutional layers, pooling, and ReLU activation functions. 
Achieved high accuracy on the test dataset by implementing robust model evaluation methods.
